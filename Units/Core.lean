CORE SI UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides the foundational SI base units and the most fundamental
derived units that are used across multiple physics domains.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- SI base units: meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela
- Fundamental derived units used everywhere:
  * Kinematics: velocity, acceleration
  * Time/Frequency: hertz, minute, hour
  * Energy/Power: joule, watt (used in mechanics, thermal, EM, chemistry)
  * Angular: radian, steradian
- Common prefixes for all base units (milli-, micro-, nano-, kilo-, mega-)
- Dimensionless quantities (ratios, fractions, angles)

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Only units that are truly fundamental and used across multiple domains belong
here. Domain-specific units (Force, Pressure, Electric Field, etc.) belong
in their respective modules to avoid this becoming a monolithic file.

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Sensor data, real-time calculations, engineering applications,
numerical simulations, measurement data, control systems

ℚ: Exact ratios, unit conversions, calibration constants,
discrete counting, financial calculations, exact fractions

ℝ: Theoretical proofs, continuous analysis, calculus-based physics,
mathematical physics, formal verification, limit calculations

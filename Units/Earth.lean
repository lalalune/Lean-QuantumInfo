EARTH SCIENCES UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for geophysics, atmospheric science,
oceanography, hydrology, seismology, and earth system science.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Seismology (magnitude scales, seismic moment, wave velocities)
- Gravity and geodesy (gravity anomalies, geoid height, isostasy)
- Geomagnetism (field strength, declination, inclination, paleomagnetic)
- Atmospheric science (geopotential height, mixing ratios, optical depth)
- Oceanography (salinity, ocean heat content, sea level, tides)
- Hydrology (discharge, infiltration, hydraulic head, groundwater)
- Geology (porosity, permeability, stress/strain, heat flow)
- Climate (radiative forcing, climate sensitivity, carbon flux)
- Geodesy (coordinates, datum transformations, map projections)
- Glaciology (ice thickness, accumulation rates, ice velocity)
- Volcanology (VEI, eruption rate, tephra volume)

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Field measurements, GPS data, seismometer readings, weather stations,
ocean buoys, satellite observations, borehole logging, climate models,
real-time monitoring, hazard assessment

ℚ: Map scale ratios, coordinate transformations, grid references,
isotope ratios, mixing ratios, mineral proportions, stratigraphic ratios

ℝ: Geophysical inversions, potential field theory, wave propagation,
mantle convection models, climate sensitivity analysis, isostatic adjustment,
theoretical seismology, geodetic datum definitions

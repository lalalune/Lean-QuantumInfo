MECHANICS UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for classical mechanics, solid mechanics,
structural engineering, and material science.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Forces and moments (Newton, pound-force, torque units)
- Pressure and stress (multiple unit systems)
- Strain and deformation (engineering and true strain)
- Elastic moduli (Young's, shear, bulk, Poisson's ratio)
- Fracture mechanics (stress intensity, J-integral, fracture toughness)
- Dynamics quantities (momentum, impulse, angular momentum)
- Work, energy, and power in mechanical context
- Viscosity and rheological properties
- Surface tension and interfacial mechanics
- Contact mechanics and tribology parameters

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Experimental measurements, sensor readings, numerical simulations,
finite element analysis, engineering calculations, real-time control systems,
fatigue testing, impact testing, material characterization

ℚ: Exact geometric ratios in crystalline materials, stoichiometric stress-strain
relationships, precise Poisson's ratios, calibration standards, discrete
dislocation dynamics, lattice mechanics

ℝ: Continuum mechanics theory, variational principles, energy minimization,
crack propagation models, constitutive law derivation, stability analysis,
formal verification of failure criteria

ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology,
stellar physics, galactic dynamics, and observational astronomy.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Astronomical distances (parsec, AU, light-year, redshift distances)
- Stellar units (solar mass, radius, luminosity, temperature)
- Planetary units (Jupiter/Earth masses and radii)
- Time scales (Gyr, Myr, kyr, Julian years)
- Luminosity and flux (absolute/apparent magnitude, Jansky, erg/s)
- Angular measurements (arcsec, mas, μas)
- Cosmological parameters (Hubble constant, density parameters)
- Galactic units (kpc, Mpc, Gpc, galaxy masses)
- Radio astronomy (Jansky, antenna temperature, brightness)
- Spectroscopy (redshift, velocity dispersion, equivalent width)
- X-ray astronomy (counts/s, keV flux)
- Gravitational astronomy (strain, chirp mass)

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Observational data, telescope measurements, photometry, astrometry,
orbit calculations, ephemerides, real-time tracking, survey data processing,
CCD reductions, adaptive optics, interferometry

ℚ: Exact unit conversions, calendar calculations, coordinate transformations,
proper motion calculations, parallax ratios, magnitude systems,
orbital period ratios, resonances

ℝ: Theoretical models, cosmological solutions, stellar structure equations,
general relativity in strong fields, black hole thermodynamics,
N-body problems, galactic dynamics, dark matter profiles

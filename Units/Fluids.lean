FLUID MECHANICS UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for fluid mechanics, rheology,
aerodynamics, hydraulics, and multiphase flow phenomena.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Viscosity (dynamic, kinematic, bulk, extensional)
- Surface tension and interfacial energy
- Flow rates (volumetric, mass, molar)
- Pressure gradients and hydraulic head
- Permeability (porous media, Darcy flow)
- Compressibility and bulk modulus
- Dimensionless numbers (Re, Ma, Fr, We, Ca, St, Pr, Gr, Ra)
- Rheological properties (shear rate, strain rate)
- Aerodynamic coefficients (drag, lift, moment)
- Hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity
- Turbulence parameters (dissipation rate, intensity)
- Multiphase flow (void fraction, slip ratio, quality)

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: CFD simulations, experimental measurements, pump/turbine calculations,
pipe flow analysis, rheometer data, wind tunnel testing, hydraulic design,
process control, real-time monitoring, drag calculations

ℚ: Exact flow rate ratios, mixing proportions, dimensionless group calculations,
stoichiometric flow rates, calibration factors, geometric similitude ratios

ℝ: Navier-Stokes solutions, boundary layer theory, potential flow analysis,
similarity solutions, asymptotic analysis, stability theory, formal verification
of conservation laws, continuum mechanics proofs

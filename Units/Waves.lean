WAVE PHYSICS UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for wave physics, acoustics, and
related phenomena. Following the triple-type architecture for maximum
flexibility without type conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Frequency units (Hz to THz and beyond)
- Wavelength units (meters to angstroms)
- Wavenumber and angular frequency
- Acoustic pressure and intensity
- Acoustic perception units (dB, phon, sone)
- Wave velocities and impedances
- Spectral densities
- Coherence and correlation functions

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Experimental measurements, signal processing, real-time acoustics
ℚ: Exact frequency ratios, musical intervals, digital signal processing
ℝ: Theoretical wave mechanics, continuous Fourier analysis

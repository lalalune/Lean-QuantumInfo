OPTICS PHYSICS UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for optical physics, photonics,
and vision science. Following the triple-type architecture for maximum
flexibility without type conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Photometric units (candela, lumen, lux, foot-candle, nit, lambert)
- Radiometric units (irradiance, radiance, spectral power, photon flux)
- Optical properties (transmittance, reflectance, refractive index, absorptance)
- Polarization states (degree of polarization, extinction ratio, retardance)
- Birefringence and optical activity (specific rotation, Verdet constant)
- Lens parameters (diopters, focal length, f-number, numerical aperture)
- Optical system metrics (magnification, field of view, Abbe number)
- Color science (color temperature, chromaticity, CRI, dominant wavelength)
- Interferometry (coherence length/time, visibility, finesse, FSR)
- Laser parameters (power, pulse energy, peak power, beam quality M²)
- Nonlinear optics (nonlinear coefficients, damage threshold)
- Fiber optics (attenuation, chromatic dispersion, V-parameter)
- Vision and display (visual acuity, contrast ratio, PPI, refresh rate)
- Quantum optics basics (photon energy, PAR units)

## USAGE PATTERNS

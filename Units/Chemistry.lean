CHEMISTRY UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for chemical kinetics, equilibria,
thermochemistry, electrochemistry, and analytical chemistry.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Reaction kinetics (rate constants for all orders, activation energy)
- pH and Acid-Base
- Equilibrium constants (Ka, Kb, Ksp, Kw, Kp, Kc)
- Concentration units (molarity, molality, normality, mole fraction)
- Thermochemistry (enthalpy, Gibbs energy, entropy changes)
- Electrochemistry (potential, current density, charge transfer)
- Spectroscopy (wavenumber, absorbance, quantum yield)
- Activity and fugacity coefficients
- Partial pressure and Henry's law constants
- Surface chemistry (adsorption, surface coverage)
- Catalysis (turnover frequency, selectivity)
- Chemical potential and fugacity

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Experimental measurements, titration calculations, pH measurements,
spectrophotometer readings, electrochemical sensors, calorimetry data,
chromatography analysis, reaction monitoring, process control

ℚ: Exact stoichiometric ratios, balanced equations, oxidation states,
molecular formulas, dilution factors, standard solutions, gravimetric factors,
equivalent weights, exact atomic masses

ℝ: Theoretical models, statistical mechanics, quantum chemistry calculations,
transition state theory, Marcus theory, RRKM theory, formal thermodynamic
derivations, chemical potential analysis, phase equilibria proofs

   Chemistry-Specific Constants for Float Calculations
================================================================================================
Mathematical and universal physical constants (pi_F, e_F, ln10_F, c_light_F, R_gas_F,
F_const_F, N_A_F, k_B_F, etc.) are in Units.Core. Use `Units.SI.pi_F` etc.

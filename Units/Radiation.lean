WAVE PHYSICS UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for radiation physics and chemistry acoustics.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximumflexibility without type conversion
friction.

## COVERAGE
- Radioactivity & decay - Becquerel, Curie, decay constants, half-lives, specific activity
- Absorbed dose - Gray, rad, and their subunits
- Equivalent dose - Sievert, rem, and their subunits
- Dose rates - Various time-based dose measurements
- Exposure - Legacy Roentgen units and SI equivalents
- Radiation weighting factors - w_R, w_T, Q, RBE
- Linear energy transfer & kerma - LET, kerma, CEMA
- Particle flux & fluence - Particle and energy flux/fluence measurements
- Cross sections - Barn and related units, macroscopic cross sections
- Attenuation & shielding - Linear/mass attenuation, HVL, TVL, buildup factors
- Neutron-specific - Lethargy, reactivity, dollars/cents, generation time
- Committed & collective doses - Person·Sv, intake coefficients

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Experimental measurements, sensor readings, numerical simulations,
iterative algorithms, display/visualization, real-time computation, engineering tolerances

ℚ: Exact stoichiometry, crystallographic ratios, unit cell parameters, Miller indices,
quantum number arithmetic, precise unit conversions, avoiding floating-point accumulation errors

ℝ: Theoretical proofs, continuous function analysis, calculus-based derivations,
mathematical physics formulations, thermodynamic limit calculations, formal verification of physical laws

INFORMATION THEORY AND DATA UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for information theory, data storage,
communication, compression, entropy measures, and computational complexity.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Information content (bits, bytes, nats, dits)
- Data storage (KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB with both binary and decimal)
- Bandwidth and data rates (bps, baud, throughput)
- Shannon entropy and information measures
- Relative entropy (KL divergence) and mutual information
- Channel capacity and error rates
- Compression ratios and algorithmic complexity
- Signal-to-noise ratios (linear and dB)
- Error rates (BER, FER, SER)
- Quantum information (qubits, ebits)
- Computational complexity measures
- Network metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss)

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Network measurements, compression algorithms, real-time communications,
signal processing, machine learning metrics, streaming data, sensor networks,
codec implementations, channel measurements

ℚ: Exact entropy calculations, lossless compression ratios, error correction
codes, cryptographic computations, discrete channel capacities,
Huffman coding, arithmetic coding, exact information measures

ℝ: Continuous entropy, differential entropy, rate-distortion theory,
information-theoretic proofs, asymptotic analysis, source coding theorems,
channel coding theorems, complexity theory bounds

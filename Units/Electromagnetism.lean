ELECTROMAGNETIC UNITS LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for electromagnetism, covering electrostatics,
magnetostatics, electrodynamics, AC circuits, and electromagnetic field theory.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Electric field quantities (field strength, potential, flux)
- Electric charge and current (charge, current density, mobility)
- Capacitance and dielectric properties
- Magnetic field quantities (B-field, H-field, flux, vector potential)
- Inductance and magnetic materials
- Resistance, conductance, impedance (including complex)
- AC circuit analysis (reactance, admittance, phase angles)
- Electromagnetic energy and power (Poynting vector, energy density)
- Electromagnetic material properties (permittivity, permeability, susceptibility)
- Electromagnetic waves and propagation
- Practical units for electronics and power engineering

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Circuit measurements, sensor readings, power calculations,
signal processing, antenna measurements, motor control, battery management,
real-time control systems, RF engineering, electromagnetic simulations

ℚ: Exact resistance ratios, precise capacitor/inductor values,
voltage divider calculations, transformer ratios, impedance matching,
crystal oscillator frequencies, digital filter coefficients

ℝ: Maxwell equations solutions, electromagnetic field theory,
wave propagation analysis, antenna theory proofs, quantum electrodynamics,
relativistic electromagnetism, formal verification of circuit theorems

   Electromagnetic Physical Constants
================================================================================================
All EM constants (c_light_F, mu0_F, epsilon0_F, e_charge_F, k_coulomb_F) are in Units.Core.
Use SI.c_light_F, SI.mu0_F, etc. Alias c_F for backward compatibility.

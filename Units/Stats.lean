STATISTICAL UNITS AND MEASURES LIBRARY
================================================================================

This module provides type-safe units for statistics, hypothesis testing,
effect sizes, model selection criteria, and uncertainty quantification.
Following the triple-type architecture for maximum flexibility without type
conversion friction.

## COVERAGE
- Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, std dev, skewness, kurtosis)
- Correlation and association (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, Cramér's V)
- Hypothesis testing (p-values, test statistics, power, error rates)
- Effect sizes (Cohen's d, Glass's Δ, Hedges' g, η², ω², f²)
- Model selection (AIC, BIC, DIC, WAIC, cross-validation)
- Bayesian statistics (Bayes factors, credible intervals, posterior)
- Regression metrics (R², adjusted R², MSE, RMSE, MAE)
- Goodness of fit (χ², KS statistic, Anderson-Darling)
- Survival analysis (hazard ratios, log-rank)
- Meta-analysis (heterogeneity, forest plots)
- Resampling (bootstrap CI, jackknife, permutation)

## USAGE PATTERNS
Float: Experimental data analysis, real-time statistics, machine learning
metrics, A/B testing, clinical trials, sensor data processing, quality control,
financial analytics, bioinformatics pipelines

ℚ: Exact probability calculations, contingency tables, discrete distributions,
combinatorial statistics, exact tests (Fisher's, binomial), rational Bayes
factors, exact confidence intervals

ℝ: Theoretical statistics, asymptotic analysis, continuous distributions,
maximum likelihood theory, information geometry, statistical manifolds,
measure-theoretic probability, stochastic processes

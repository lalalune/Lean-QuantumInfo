# Analyticity of the Resolvent

This file proves that the resolvent `R(z)` is analytic as a function of `z`
in the region where `Im(z) ≠ 0`. Specifically, we show that near any point
`z₀` with `Im(z₀) ≠ 0`, the resolvent has a convergent power series expansion.

## Main statements

* `resolventFun_hasSum`: Near `z₀`, the resolvent has power series
  `R(z) = ∑ₙ (z - z₀)ⁿ R(z₀)^{n+1}`

## Implementation notes

The proof uses the Neumann series: since `R(z₀)` is bounded by `1/|Im(z₀)|`,
for `z` close enough to `z₀` the operator `(z - z₀) R(z₀)` has norm less than 1,
and we can expand `R(z) = R(z₀) (1 - (z - z₀) R(z₀))⁻¹` using the Neumann series.

## Physics interpretation

Analyticity of the resolvent is fundamental to spectral theory. It allows us to
define the spectral projections via contour integrals (Stone's formula) and
underlies perturbation theory for quantum systems.

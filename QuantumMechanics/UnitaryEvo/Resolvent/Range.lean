# Surjectivity of (A - zI) for Self-Adjoint Generators

This module proves that for a self-adjoint generator `A` and any `z` with
`Im(z) ≠ 0`, the operator `(A - zI)` is surjective.

## Main result

* `self_adjoint_range_all_z`: The equation `(A - zI)ψ = φ` has a unique
  solution for every `φ ∈ H`.

## Proof outline

1. **Orthogonal complement is trivial** (`Orthogonal.lean`): `ran(A-zI)⊥ = {0}`
2. **Range is closed** (`ClosedRange.lean`): Uses the lower bound estimate
3. **Closed + dense = everything** (`Surjectivity.lean`): Assembles the result

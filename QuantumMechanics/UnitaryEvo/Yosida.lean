# Yosida Approximation and Stone's Theorem (Converse)

This module provides a complete proof of the converse of Stone's theorem:
every self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space generates a strongly continuous
one-parameter unitary group via the exponential map `U(t) = exp(itA)`.

## Overview

The construction proceeds via Yosida approximation:

1. **Approximate the unbounded `A`** by bounded operators `Aₙ` using resolvents at `z = ±in`
2. **Show `exp(i·Aₙ·t)` is unitary** because `i·Aₙ` is skew-adjoint
3. **Use Duhamel's formula** to relate `U(t) - exp(i·Aₙ·t)` to an integral of `(A - Aₙ)`
4. **Prove `Aₙ → A` pointwise** on the domain, so the Duhamel integral vanishes
5. **Take limits** to obtain `exp(itA)` with all desired properties

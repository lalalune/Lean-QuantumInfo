/-! ## Part 15: Sequential Measurements and Entropy Budget

When Alice measures once, she produces entropy ΔS ≥ 2π nats.
What happens when she measures again?

Key questions:
- Does the second measurement cost the same 2π?
- Is there a "discount" because the state is already disturbed?
- How does irreversibility factor in?

/-! ### The Irreversibility Structure

Key insight: measurement is irreversible because it produces entropy.
The 2π nats is the MINIMUM — actual measurements may produce more.

The "disturbed state" after measurement is in an eigenstate.
Remeasuring the SAME observable costs nothing (already determined).
Measuring a DIFFERENT observable costs the full 2π.

/-! ### Connection to Correlations

The sequential measurement structure affects correlations:
- If Alice measures, waits, measures again with SAME setting: perfect correlation
- If Alice measures, waits, measures again with DIFFERENT setting: correlation depends on wait time

  have := Real.tendsto_exp_neg_atTop_nhds_zero.comp h
  convert this using 1
  ext t
  simp [neg_div]

/-! ### The Quantum Zeno Connection

Rapid repeated measurements "freeze" the system in an eigenstate.
This is because no entropy is produced for same-setting measurements.

The system only evolves (and produces entropy) when the setting changes.

/-! ### Information-Theoretic Interpretation

Each measurement produces at most 1 bit of information (log 2 nats).
The entropy cost 2π nats >> ln 2 ≈ 0.693 nats.

The "excess" entropy 2π - ln 2 ≈ 5.59 nats represents:
- Irreversible disturbance to the measured system
- Heat dissipated to the environment
- "Cost of doing business" with quantum systems

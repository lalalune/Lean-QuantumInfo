# Tomita-Takesaki Modular Theory and the KMS Condition

This file contains a formal interface for the fundamental connection between
modular theory and the KMS condition:

**Every faithful normal state on a von Neumann algebra is KMS at β = 1 with respect
to its modular automorphism group.**

## The Story

In 1967, Tomita discovered (and Takesaki clarified) that every von Neumann algebra
M with a cyclic separating vector Ω carries canonical structure:

1. The **Tomita operator** S : AΩ ↦ A*Ω (antilinear, closable)
2. The polar decomposition S = JΔ^{1/2} gives:
   - **Modular operator** Δ (positive, self-adjoint, generally unbounded)
   - **Modular conjugation** J (antiunitary involution)
3. The **modular automorphism group** σ_t(A) = Δ^{it} A Δ^{-it}

The miraculous theorem: the state ω(A) = ⟨Ω, AΩ⟩ satisfies the KMS condition
at β = 1 with respect to σ_t. In other words:

**The modular flow IS thermal time evolution at temperature T = 1/k_B.**

This is the mathematical foundation of the "thermal time hypothesis" in quantum
gravity and the reason modular theory appears throughout quantum field theory.

## What We Axiomatize

Since the full Tomita-Takesaki theory requires:
- Von Neumann algebras (weak operator topology, preduals)
- Unbounded operators (densely defined, closed, polar decomposition)
- Cyclic and separating vectors
- The actual construction of Δ and J

We model:
1. `IsVonNeumannAlgebra` - the property of being a von Neumann algebra
2. `IsFaithfulNormal` - the property of a state being faithful and normal
3. `modularAutomorphismGroup` - the existence of the modular automorphism group
4. `modular_is_kms` - the KMS property interface used in downstream results

/-! ## Von Neumann Algebras

A von Neumann algebra is a C*-algebra that is also closed in the weak operator
topology (equivalently, equals its double commutant, or has a predual).

We model this as a typeclass property.
-/

/-- The property of being a von Neumann algebra.

Mathematically, this means:
- A is a *-subalgebra of B(H) for some Hilbert space H
- A is closed in the weak (or strong) operator topology
- Equivalently: A = A'' (double commutant theorem)
- Equivalently: A has a predual A_* with A = (A_*)*

/-! ## Faithful Normal States

On a von Neumann algebra, "normal" states are the physically relevant ones.
They correspond to density matrices and are continuous in the weak* topology.

"Faithful" means ω(a*a) = 0 implies a = 0.

/-- A state is faithful if ω(a*a) = 0 implies a = 0. -/
def State.IsFaithful (ω : State A) : Prop :=
  ∀ a : A, ω (star a * a) = 0 → a = 0

/-- A state is normal if it is weak*-continuous (equivalently, comes from the predual).

On B(H), this means ω(A) = Tr(ρA) for some density matrix ρ.

/-! ## The Modular Automorphism Group

The crown jewel of Tomita-Takesaki theory: every faithful normal state ω on a
von Neumann algebra M determines a canonical one-parameter automorphism group σ^ω,
called the modular automorphism group.

Construction (sketch):
1. GNS representation: (H_ω, π_ω, Ω_ω) with ω(a) = ⟨Ω_ω, π_ω(a)Ω_ω⟩
2. Ω_ω is cyclic (by GNS) and separating (by faithfulness)
3. Define S : π_ω(a)Ω_ω ↦ π_ω(a*)Ω_ω
4. S is closable; take polar decomposition S̄ = JΔ^{1/2}
5. The modular automorphism group is σ_t(a) = Δ^{it} a Δ^{-it}

Properties:
- σ_t is a *-automorphism for each t
- t ↦ σ_t is a group homomorphism
- t ↦ σ_t(a) is strongly continuous
- ω is σ-invariant: ω ∘ σ_t = ω
- ω satisfies KMS at β = 1 with respect to σ

normal states, their modular automorphism groups differ by a cocycle.

This means the modular flow is "almost unique" - unique up to inner automorphisms.

/-! ## The Main Theorem: Modular States are KMS

This is the fundamental result of Tomita-Takesaki theory in its thermodynamic
interpretation. The state ω is KMS at β = 1 with respect to its own modular
automorphism group.

The proof requires constructing the KMS function F_{a,b}(z) explicitly:
- F_{a,b}(t) = ω(a · σ_t(b)) for t real
- Extend analytically to the strip 0 < Im(z) < 1
- Show F_{a,b}(t + i) = ω(σ_t(b) · a)

The analyticity comes from the spectral theory of Δ:
  ω(a · Δ^{iz} b Δ^{-iz}) is analytic in z for 0 < Im(z) < 1

For now, we axiomatize this as the fundamental property of σ^ω.
-/

/-- **The Fundamental Theorem of Modular Theory (KMS version)**:
A faithful normal state ω on a von Neumann algebra is KMS at inverse temperature
β = 1 with respect to its modular automorphism group σ^ω.

This is the deepest connection between operator algebras and thermodynamics.
It says that every quantum state carries an intrinsic notion of "thermal time"
at temperature T = 1/k_B.

-- (The old `ModularAutGroup` axiom can be removed)

/-- **Takesaki's Theorem**: A faithful normal state ω on a von Neumann algebra
is KMS at β = 1 with respect to its modular automorphism group σ^ω.

This follows immediately from our axiom `modular_is_kms_at_one`, which
encodes the actual theorem of Tomita-Takesaki theory.

/-! ## Scaling: KMS at Arbitrary Temperature

The modular group gives KMS at β = 1. What about other temperatures?

If we rescale time: α_t = σ_{t/β}, then ω is KMS at inverse temperature β
with respect to α. This is just reparametrization.

/-! ## Rescaling KMS States

The key lemma: if ω is KMS at β₁ for dynamics α, then ω is KMS at β₂ for the
rescaled dynamics α_{t·β₁/β₂}. This is just reparametrization of time.

/-! ## Physical Interpretation

### The Thermal Time Hypothesis

Connes and Rovelli proposed that in quantum gravity, where there is no preferred
time, the modular flow provides a natural notion of time evolution. The state
of the universe determines its own time!

### Connection to Black Hole Physics

In the algebraic approach to quantum field theory on curved spacetime:
- The Unruh effect: an accelerated observer sees the vacuum as a thermal state
- The Hawking temperature of a black hole emerges from modular theory
- The Bisognano-Wichmann theorem: modular flow = Lorentz boosts for Rindler wedges

### Why β = 1?

The appearance of β = 1 is a choice of units. In natural units where
ℏ = k_B = 1, the modular Hamiltonian K = -log Δ gives evolution e^{-itK}
and temperature T = 1.

For different units, rescale: σ^ω_t at β = 1 becomes α_t = σ^ω_{t/β} at
inverse temperature β.
